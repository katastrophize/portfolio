## ABOUT ME

Hello, my name is *Kat*

Iâ€™m an aspiring _**UX/UI Designer**_ with a background in hospitality leadership, blending nearly a decade of guest experience with human-centered design. I bring the same instinct for anticipating needs, orchestrating smooth experiences, and leading with empathy into every digital product I create.

When I'm not in front of my computer, you can find me in the wild:
* Surfing
* Indoor climbing
* Baking pastries for friends and family

Here's one of my pastry creations:
